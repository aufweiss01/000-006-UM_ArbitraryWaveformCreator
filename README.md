# General

This project is a short documentation example created for exercising and demonstration purposes. 

The documentation's content is based on a user manual for the EasyArb application of the [R&S^(R)^ HMC804x series](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/de/handbuch/r-s-hmc804x-power-supply-bedienhandbuch-handbuecher_78701-78982.html). 

The original contents have been:
- restructured
- migrated to Markdown
- exported to HTML and PDF
